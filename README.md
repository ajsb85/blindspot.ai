Blind Spot Warning (BSW) systems are a great way to keep yourself and others safe on the road. They use sensors to monitor your blind spots and alert you if there's a vehicle in your blind spot. This is usually indicated by a light on or near your side mirrors. If you don't notice the light and try to change lanes, an alarm will warn you that doing so is unsafe.

Some of the newer BSW systems can even detect vehicles in your trailer's blind spot if you tow one. Additionally, some car manufacturers use this same technology to provide "Cross-Traffic Alerts" when backing up. It is beneficial when you can't see what's approaching from the left or right behind your vehicle.

Blind spot detection has been shown to reduce lane-change crashes by 14 per cent ([Cicchino, 2018](https://www.iihs.org/topics/bibliography/ref/2143)). HLDI research has also found that blind spot detection lowers rates of insurance claims covering injuries and damage to other vehicles ([HLDI, 2023](https://www.iihs.org/media/d391f0fa-2c92-4308-a27f-c93d60757e55/3VeIsw/HLDI%20Research/Collisions%20avoidance%20features/40-04-compendium.pdf)).

It's important to remember that while these systems are beneficial, they're not meant to replace safe and responsible driving. It would help if you remained attentive and mindful while on the road. Never rely solely on these systems to keep you safe.
